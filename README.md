Use the arrow keys to move around. Keep an eye on your health bar at the top right. Your player inventory is at the top left. Use the numbers or scroll wheel to select the item you would like to use. Hold the left mouse button to start breaking blocks near you and stand over them to pick them up. Use tools to break blocks more efficiently. You can try attacking mobs by simply punching them but a sword is much better! Equip your sword and hold the left button again to slash at your enemies. Don't forget to gather the loot after you send them back to where they came from! Build shelter by right clicking with a block selected in your inventory. Be creative! When you've built to your heart's content, consider digging downwards to explore the secrets that lie beneath you. Make sure you're well equipped to face the dangers that you may come across. Perhaps you will find massive caves and precious resources too ;)
